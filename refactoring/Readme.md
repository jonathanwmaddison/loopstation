## Introduction

This document serves as a guide for refactoring the Digital Looper project. It outlines the general approach to refactoring, lists specific areas that need improvement, and provides a strategy for implementing these changes while maintaining the functionality of the application.

## Refactoring Guidelines

When refactoring the Digital Looper project, adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Maintain Functionality**: Ensure that each refactor does not break existing features.
2. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component and function should have a single, well-defined purpose.
3. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminate code duplication by extracting common functionality into reusable components or hooks.
4. **Improve Readability**: Use clear naming conventions and add comments where necessary to explain complex logic.
5. **Enhance Testability**: Structure code in a way that facilitates unit testing.
6. **Optimize Performance**: Look for opportunities to improve rendering and audio processing efficiency.
7. **Follow React Best Practices**: Utilize hooks effectively and avoid anti-patterns.
8. **Type Safety**: Implement TypeScript to improve type safety and developer experience.

## Refactoring Priorities

Prioritize refactoring efforts in the following order:

1. Critical bug fixes and performance issues
2. Code structure and organization
3. Implementation of TypeScript
4. Enhancement of reusability and modularity
5. Improvement of state management
6. Optimization of audio processing
7. User interface and experience improvements

## Specific Refactors Needed

### 1. Implement TypeScript

- Convert all `.js` files to `.tsx`
- Define interfaces for component props and state
- Create types for audio-related objects and functions

### 2. Reorganize Project Structure

- Move components into a dedicated `components` directory
- Create a `hooks` directory for custom hooks
- Establish a `utils` directory for helper functions
- Set up a `constants` file for magic numbers and string constants

### 3. Extract Audio Logic into Custom Hooks

- Create a `useAudioContext` hook for managing the audio context
- Implement a `useTrackRecording` hook for handling track recording logic
- Develop a `useTrackPlayback` hook for managing track playback

### 4. Improve State Management

- Consider using Context API or a state management library like Zustand for global state
- Reduce prop drilling by lifting state up where appropriate

### 5. Enhance Component Modularity

- Break down the `Track` component into smaller, more focused components
- Create a separate `TrackControls` component for track-specific buttons and sliders

### 6. Optimize Audio Processing

- Implement audio worklets for more efficient audio processing
- Use `OfflineAudioContext` for non-real-time processing tasks

### 7. Improve Error Handling

- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add error handling for audio operations and API calls

### 8. Enhance Accessibility

- Add proper ARIA labels to all interactive elements
- Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly
- Implement focus management for modal dialogs and complex interactions

### 9. Optimize Rendering

- Use `React.memo` for components that don't need frequent re-renders
- Implement `useMemo` and `useCallback` hooks where appropriate to prevent unnecessary recalculations

### 10. Implement Code Splitting

- Use dynamic imports for components that are not immediately needed
- Implement route-based code splitting using Next.js's built-in capabilities

## Testing Strategy

- Implement Jest for unit testing
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Set up Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Aim for at least 80% test coverage for critical path code

## Refactoring Workflow

1. **Create a Branch**: Always create a new branch for each refactoring task.
2. **Write Tests**: If tests don't exist, write them before refactoring to ensure functionality is preserved.
3. **Refactor**: Implement the refactoring changes.
4. **Run Tests**: Ensure all tests pass after refactoring.
5. **Code Review**: Submit a pull request and have at least one other developer review the changes.
6. **Merge**: Once approved, merge the refactored code into the main branch.

Remember to update this document as new refactoring needs are identified or as the project evolves. Regular refactoring sessions should be scheduled to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.


## Changelog

### 2024-09-02: Major Refactoring and UI Overhaul

1. **TypeScript Implementation**
   - Converted `app/page.tsx` from JavaScript to TypeScript.
   - Added type definitions for track data, component props, and audio-related objects.
   - Implemented proper typing for state variables and function parameters.

2. **shadcn/ui Integration**
   - Manually added core shadcn/ui components:
     - Button (`components/ui/button.tsx`)
     - Card (`components/ui/card.tsx`)
     - Slider (`components/ui/slider.tsx`)
   - Created utility functions for class name merging (`lib/utils.ts`).
   - Updated `app/page.tsx` to use new shadcn/ui components for improved UI consistency and aesthetics.

3. **Component Refactoring**
   - Refactored `Track` component (`components/Track.tsx`) to use TypeScript and shadcn/ui components.
   - Updated `WaveformVisualizer` component (`components/WaveformVisualizer.tsx`) to use TypeScript and wrapped it in a shadcn/ui Card for consistent styling.

4. **Styling Updates**
   - Updated `tailwind.config.ts` to include necessary configurations for shadcn/ui:
     - Added custom color definitions using CSS variables.
     - Included custom keyframes and animations for components like accordions.
     - Added chart color definitions for potential future use.
   - Updated `globals.css` to include CSS variable definitions for both light and dark modes, ensuring proper theming support.

5. **Project Structure Improvements**
   - Organized new UI components in a dedicated `components/ui` directory.
   - Added a `lib` directory for utility functions.

6. **Documentation**
   - Updated this refactoring guide to include the latest changes and new sections.
   - Added a changelog to track significant updates and refactoring efforts.

### Next Steps
- Implement error handling for audio operations.
- Extract audio logic into custom hooks for better separation of concerns.
- Add unit tests for the refactored components.
- Implement accessibility improvements, including proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.
- Consider adding more advanced audio features like quantization and loop length setting.

This changelog represents a significant step forward in modernizing the Digital Looper project, improving its type safety, UI consistency, and overall code quality. The integration of shadcn/ui components provides a solid foundation for future UI enhancements and ensures a more maintainable codebase moving forward.
